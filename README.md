# Hi!👋 
## Basics
I'm a lawyer by day, geek by night and a full-time ND.
👔 I teach law and do some [academic writing](https://tuomas.prof). On the side, I do some [legal](https://legalwise.fi) and/or [geeky](https://pilvity.fi) stuff. I also study a bit ([cyber security](https://www.jyu.fi) and [teaching](https://www.tuni.fi)).
## Interests
⚖️ I'm mainly interested in criminal and processual law, especially in relation to international conflicts. I'm quite experienced with private law, especially with contracts, employment, IT and data protection law.
🤓 I like Debian, K8s, Ansible, Python and PHP. I support FOSS where I can and try to make some money with it.
